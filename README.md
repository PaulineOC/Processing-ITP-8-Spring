# Processing-ITP-8-Spring

This game was supposed to be a simple “Welcome” to the spring and a farewell to the winter. I used the color tracking technique, so the player is a bird. In the background, the snow and rain fall. The bird must simply catch the sun and then slowly the bad weather will clear.
